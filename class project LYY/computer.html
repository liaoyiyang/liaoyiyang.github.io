					<h2>Computer Science Program Description</h2>
					<h4>
						1.Program Description
					</h4>
					<p>
						Do you want to know how to design and program the computers powering some of today’s
						greatest innovations? Ever wondered how your phone knows where the nearest Starbucks is, how Google’s self-driving
						car is even possible, or how your music and photos live in the cloud? Maybe you want to know how computers protect
						businesses — and people — and other cybersecurity issues. AUM’s Computer Science Program, with a curriculum based
						on the latest ACM/IEEE recommendations and an emphasis on high-performance computing, will prepare you for a
						career in computer programming, networking, database management, multimedia design or technology architecture.
					</p>
					<h4>
						2.Points of Pride
					</h4>
					<p>	
						You’ll have access to the most powerful computational resources and expertise in the
						country through our partnership with the NSF-supported Extreme Science and Engineering
						Discovery Environment.

						Computer Science faculty are engaged in the private sector, supporting research and partnerships with national and
						international user groups and initiatives.
